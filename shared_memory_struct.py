Shared memory structure definition calculator for dynamic shared memory in CUDA kernels.
Simplifies the calculation of the start of a member of a struct for each thread.

Shared memory structures are sequences of arrays of elements, each element being its own itemsize bytes large.
The arrays of elements may be padded at the end for alignment of subsequent arrays.  The full structure may be
padded to make the entire structure a multiple of the largest itemsize in bytes, since structures for each thread
follow, and so it must be possible for an element in a subsequent structure to be aligned on the same itemsize number
of bytes.

The shared memory structure must start at a different value (address % NUMBER_SHARED_MEMORY_BANKS) for each thread.
Constraints:
 - The offset of the start of the structure for a thread index modulo NUMBER_SHARED_MEMORY_BANKS must be:
        - a unique residue of the number of shared memory banks;  and
        - be a multiple of the shared memory word size; and
        - a multiple of the maximum itemsize.
   For the first requirement, (Address_in_bytes_of_a_structure // SHARED_MEMORY_WORD_SIZE) % NUMBER_SHARED_MEMORY_BANKS
   must be a unique number in the range(0, NUMBER_SHARED_MEMORY_BANKS), for groups of NUMBER_SHARED_MEMORY_BANKS number of threads.
   
 - The offset for each field of the structure must be an integral number of itemsize elements from the beginning of
   shared memory.  This is partially fulfilled by the structure being padded to make it an integral number of the maximum
   itemsize.  An additional requirement is to pad the space between structures so that it is also an integral number
   of the maximum itemsize.

** Note that the shared memory word size must be at least as large as the largest itemsize. **
